A user friendly sales tracker for a donut fundraiser

This was created when WOSS Mutual (a school club dedicated to improving the efficiency of fundraisers) ran a donut sale.
The software tracks how many donuts were sold in different deals (12 for $10 as opposed to 1 for $1) and at what times. This data was automatically added to an excel spreadsheet using an external library.
